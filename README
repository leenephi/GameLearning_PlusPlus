C++ Game Learning Stuff

Goal: 

To make a game that works, pwns, and.. works. Oh, it should be pretty fun, too.

Direction:

-As of now, it will be a 2D Platformer game.. having stages/levels based off of premade files.


Genre Possibilities: 

-Zombies & guns (we'd change the graphics of course ;))
-D&D Platformer.. each level could be deeper into a dungeon.. the level would be kind of like a maze
 You could find items, powerups, treasure on the way down.
